# Outlook Calendar Inviter

## Project Overview:
- Each month, our team organizes a series of actions by sending out monthly calendar invites via Outlook.  However, the process of updating the dates and sending the invites used to require a manager to manually send more than 50 calendar invites each month.
- Built a vba script that loops over an Excel spreadsheet and sends Outlook meeting invites in seconds.
